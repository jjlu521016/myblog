SECTION 4

## Clustering
A cluster is a group of computer systems that work together to form what appears to the user as a single system. Clusters are deployed to improve services availability or to increase computational or data manipulation performance. In terms of equivalent computing power, a cluster is more cost-effective than a monolithic system with the same performance characteristics.

The systems in a cluster are interconnected over high-speed local area networks like gigabit Ethernet, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI), Infiniband, Myrinet, or other technologies.

**Figure 7: Load Balancing Cluster**
  

**Load-balancing cluster (active/active)**: Distribute the load among multiple back-end, redundant nodes. All nodes in the cluster offer full-service capabilities to the consumers and are active at the same time.

**High availability cluster (active/passive)**: Improve services availability by providing uninterrupted service through redundant clusters that eliminate single points of failure. High availability clusters require two nodes at a minimum, a "heartbeat" to detect that all nodes are ready, and a routing mechanism that will automatically switch traffic, or fail over, if the main cluster fails.

**Figure 8: Cluster Failover**

**Grid**: Process workloads defined as independent jobs that don't require data sharing among processes. Storage or network may be shared across all nodes of the grid, but intermediate results have no bearing on other jobs progress or on other nodes in the grid, such as a Cloudera Map Reduce cluster ([http://www.cloudera.com](http://www.cloudera.com/)).

**Figure 9: Computational Clusters**

**Computational clusters**: Execute processes that require raw computational power instead of executing transactional operations like web or database clusters. The nodes are tightly coupled, homogeneous, and in close physical proximity. They often replace supercomputers.
