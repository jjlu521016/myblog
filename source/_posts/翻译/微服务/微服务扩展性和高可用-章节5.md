SECTION 5

## Redundancy and Fault Tolerance
Redundant system design depends on the expectation that any system component failure is independent of failure in the other components.

Fault tolerant systems continue to operate in the event of component or subsystem failure; throughput may decrease but overall system availability remains constant. Faults in hardware or software are handled through component redundancy or safe fallbacks, if one can be made in software. Fault tolerance in software is often implemented as a fallback method if a dependent system is unavailable. Fault tolerance requirements are derived from SLAs. The implementation depends on the hardware and software components, and on the rules by which they interact.

### Fault Tolerance SLA Requirements
+ No single point of failure: Redundant components ensure continuous operation and allow repairs without disruption of service.
+ Fault isolation: Problem detection must pinpoint the specific faulty component
+ Fault propagation containment: Faults in one component must not cascade to others.
+ Reversion mode: Set the system back to a known state.  

Redundant clustered systems can provide higher availability, better throughput, and fault tolerance. The A/A cluster in Figure 10 provides uninterrupted service for a scalable, stateless application.

Some stateful applications may only scale up; the A/P cluster in Figure 11 provides uninterrupted service and disaster recovery for such an application. Active/Active configurations provide failure transparency. Active/Passive configurations may provide failure transparency at a much higher cost because automatic failure detection and reconfiguration are implemented through a feedback control system, which is more expensive and trickier to implement.

**Figure 11: A/P fault tolerance and recovery**

Enterprise systems most commonly implement A/P fault tolerance and recovery through fault transparency by diverting services to the passive system and bringing it on-line as soon as possible. Robotics and life-critical systems may implement probabilistic, linear model, fault hiding, and optimization control systems instead.

### Multi-Region
Redundant systems often span multiple regions in order to isolate geographic phenomenon, provide failover capabilities, and deliver content as close to the consumer as possible. These redundancies cascade down through the system into all services, and a single scalable system may have a number of load balanced clusters throughout.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing describes applications running on distributed, computing resources owned and operated by a third-party.

End-user apps are the most common examples. They utilize the Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) computing models.

### Cloud Services Types
+ Web services: Salesforce com, USPS, Google Maps.
+ Service platforms: Google App Engine, Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, Cloud Front), Nirvanix, Akamai, MuleSource.  

### Fault Detection Methods
Fault detection methods must provide enough information to isolate the fault and execute automatic or assisted failover action. Some of the most common fault detection methods include:

+ Built-in diagnostics.
+ Protocol sniffers.
+ Sanity checks.
+ Watchdog checks.  

Criticality is defined as the number of consecutive faults reported by two or more detection mechanisms over a fixed time period. A fault detection mechanism is useless if it reports every single glitch (noise) or if it fails to report a real fault over a number of monitoring periods.
